# Job Listing App — Cygnus Assignment

This is a small React + Vite demo implementing the Job Board assignment features.

Features implemented:

- Display job cards
- Location filter (Remote / On-site)
- Job type filter (Internship / Full-time)
- Live search that highlights match in title
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS
- Optional alphabetical sort

Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes

- This scaffold uses Tailwind CSS. If you prefer plain CSS, I can switch it.
- I did not create a remote GitHub repo — files are in the workspace. Tell me if you want me to initialize a repo and push.
